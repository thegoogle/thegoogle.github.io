<p> I have lived my life without my love and it has been very painful so far. My lord gave me everything but love. This world was a beautiful place and i wish i could have lived a happy life here. But anyways we are all destined to our fate and we cannot control the natural forces. I accepted the reality and decided not to move with anyone else. </p>

<p>One day, I will die. I wish that my death will be less painful. The life without love was very painfula and i wish to die having her sight in my eyes. She should be the last thing i should see in my life. I also wish that  some kith and kin or one of the friends will burn my deceased body on holy fire. I want to be burnt the moment I am found dead.</p>
